# TVShowTrivia
This Python project is a program for a multiple choice quiz/trivia. It has six straightforward
questions from the sitcom "The Office". This is a program made for pass-time fun rather than for
achieving a specific task and it is a great solution for curing boredom after finishing the show.You answer
the multiple choice questions and at the end it gives you a final score. It also allows you to play again
if you would like.
